# _Specs_
- Write a method to convert numbers into Roman numerals. Roman numerals are based on seven symbols:

|Symbol|Value|
|---|---|
|I|1|
|V|5|
|X|10|
|L|50|
|C|100|
|D|500|
|M|1000|

- The most basic rule is that you add the value of all the symbols: so II is 2, LXVI is 66, etc.
- The exception is that there may not be more than three of the same characters in a row. Instead, you switch to subtraction. So instead of writing IIII for 4, you write IV (for 5 minus 1); and instead of writing LXXXX for 90, you write XC.
- You also have to separate ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands. In other words, 99 is XCIX, not IC. You cannot count higher than 3,999 in Roman numerals.
